# Alisha Chugani

My name is Alisha, which means protected by God. I am twenty one years old and I am from Panama City, Panama. I have a younger sister that is a senior in high school. I belong to a supportive, loving and affectionate family. I consider myself a very inpatient person. I like things to happen more rapidly than to have the process slowed down. I am currently a first semester senior at University of Miami.
