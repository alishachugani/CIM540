# What to eat app

 The app would let individuals know what food they should avoid when sick and what would make them feel better. When opening the app it will ask for what is it that you have ex: stomach flu.  After writing down what you have it will make you choose between foods to avoid or what to eat. You would select depending if you are looking for something to eat that would help you feel better or if you want to know what to avoid so you donâ€™t make the mistake of making yourself feel worse. After the selection it will give you a list to go through and after that you can either go back or start all over.
